#bad batching

ready.gov

the registration intake portal

teased out whether it was captured by phone bank or mible app

there's a lag time for those updates

i would say
it's not a true api
it's somewhere...
there's a certain amount of lag

the information is in constant flux

there might be some erroneous
data discrepanccies

they also collect info directly in the field
sometimes that might be kep tlocally
and pushed to headquarters
and that's

might be some dpulicates

whole number of issues

there are mechanisms in place

we in the mapping side
kick things out if
too far outside a given perimeter of a county
people from
neighboring counties that havent been declared
or flagged for ppotential fraudulence

there's a whole bunch of ways that
that ineligibility could be kicked in if tha tmakes sense

if you look at it
that's sor tof the problem

there could be multple disasers coming at he  same time
each one has a given set of circumstances

found wildfires in oregoan last year
lots of fraudlent claims
in counties that werent even impacted by the wildfires

they still get processed
they get assigned a reg id number
but it's people in a variety of manner

searching fo rmoney 

it gets assigned based on the address input

bu tsometimes verifiation process
it's not a valid address
it gets further flagged

i would say the data you see
is not the full extent of the different
flags and criteria we put in place
valid registration

valid address
some type of address 

it's

always the best explanation i can come up with
it's like taking an instant census taht's validated as it's going

so you know
the proverbial crap hits teh fan
you're going to get a myriad of data integrity errors
as it progresses
the things that are addressed
sort of tease out any hiccups and locations
autoassigning to the appropriate county

it is... each person's individual situation
is wildly different fro their neighbors

there's legal aid societies
deed and title
documents
that sort of prove down the line
sometimes that takes a couple of months to tease out
just depends on the area of the country
happened in 2016 in flooding events of louisiana
it's not uncommon
people lose documentation in the specific event
so you know there's no record

oregon wildfires

doing my taxes...
i started in january



insurance aspect is a little bit of a blackhole
